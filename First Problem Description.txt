First Problem Description

You are given a directed graph G = (V, E), where:
- V is the set of nodes representing locations.
- E is the set of paths between nodes.

For multiple queries, each defined by a pair of distinct vertices (S, D):
- Determine the set of vertices that lie on at least one path from S to D, excluding S and D themselves.
- If no path exists from S to D, report that it is impossible.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers NV and NA, the number of vertices and edges, respectively.
- The next NA lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ NV), representing a directed edge from u to v.
- After the edges, a line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.
- Each of the next Q lines contains two integers S and D, the start and end vertices for a query.

Output Format:
- For each query, output a single integer: the number of vertices (including S and D) that lie on any path from S to D.
- If no path exists, output "IMPOSIBLE".
- After each set of queries for a graph, output a line containing "---" to separate test cases.

Constraints:
- 2 ≤ NV ≤ 10,000
- 0 ≤ NA ≤ 100,000
- The total number of queries times the number of edges does not exceed 10^7.
