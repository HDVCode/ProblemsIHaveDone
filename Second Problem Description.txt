Second Problem Description

You are given a supermarket scenario with:
- N cash registers (numbered 1 to N).
- A queue of C customers, each with a known processing time.

There is a **single queue** serving all registers. The first customer in the queue goes to the first available register (lowest number if multiple registers are free). Each register processes customers independently.  

A new customer (Ismael) arrives at the end of the queue. Determine **which register he will be assigned to** based on the current queue and processing times.

Input Format:
- Each test case consists of two lines:
  - Line 1: Two integers N and C, the number of registers and customers in the queue.
  - Line 2: C integers representing the service time of each customer in the queue, in order.
- The input ends with a line `0 0`, which should not be processed.

Output Format:
- For each test case, output a single integer: the register number where the new customer will be served.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
- 0 ≤ C ≤ 10^5
- Service times are positive integers.

Example:

Input:
2 2
10 5
2 2
5 10
3 2
5 10
0 0

Output:
2
1
3
